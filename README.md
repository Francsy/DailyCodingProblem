### Problems, problems, problems...

In our best days, **programming feels like performing magic**. It's like we're attending the fourth year at Hogwarts School. Everything just... WORKS!!

**Except when it doesn´t...** Not every day is a good day, and programming doesn't always feel easy.... There are times when our code *simply doesn't work...* 

But just like at Hogwarts, **what does work is the training**. That's why I've created this repository where I will try to solve problems posted by https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/

My solutions can be found in the [dailycodingproblem.js](./dailycodingproblem.js) file of this repository.

I encourage you to try them out too. Train, train, and train... and **may the magic be with you!!!**
